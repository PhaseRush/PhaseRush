### I'm PhaseRush ðŸ‘‹. Thanks for visiting my portfolio.

I'm a return intern at [AWS Canada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) (Vancouver represent!), and a senior at UBC studying CS.

I enjoy learning new languages and technologies; currently, I'm working on visualizations to understand data better
