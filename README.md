### I'm PhaseRush 👋. Thanks for visiting my portfolio.

I'm an engineer at [AWS Canada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) (Vancouver represent!), and an alumni of UBC CS.

I enjoy learning new languages and technologies; currently, I'm working on mentoring students and helping them reach their dreams.
